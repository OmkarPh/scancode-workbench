:index:`Import a JSON File`
=============================

To import a ScanCode JSON file:

We've provided a set of sample scans that you can quickly review in ScanCode Workbench in order
to get a sense of its functionality and the types of information captured by a scan.  The samples
are located at `https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/tree/develop/samples <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/tree/develop/samples>`_.


* Open the :kbd:`File` menu and select :kbd:`Import JSON File` (keyboard shortcut:
  :kbd:`Ctrl+I` or :kbd:`âŒ˜+I`).

     Click Import a JSON scan file.

     Or
     Simply click on the Import ScanCode JSON button

* In the dialog window that opens, navigate to the JSON file you want to import, select the
  file and click :kbd:`Open`.
* You will then be prompted to choose a filename and location to save the JSON file as a SQLite
  database file.  Add a filename, select the folder in which you want to save the SQLite database
  file, and click :kbd:`Save`.
* ScanCode Workbench will then create a SQLite database file from your JSON file, indicated by
  the status message ``Processing scan - <Progress percentage>``

     ..

     The JSON scan file is being converted to a SQLite file.

* Once the process has finished, the status message will be replaced by an expandable code tree
  (the **Directory Tree**) and, to the right of the tree, a table (the **Table View**) displaying
  provenance information generated by ScanCode.

     The SQLite version of your JSON scan is ready for your analysis.
