ScanCode Workbench provides an advanced visual UI to help you quickly evaluate
license and other notices identified by 
[ScanCode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/).
[ScanCode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/) detects licenses, copyrights 
and other interesting information in your code.

ScanCode Workbench is based on
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and will be the primary desktop/GUI tool 
for using nexBâ€™s [AboutCode tools](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode). This app 
works on Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems.

## Using

* You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/releases) 
for your operating system or build it yourself (see below). Once downloaded, you 
can find `ScanCode-Workbench` under `dist/ScanCode-Workbench-<os>-x64-<version>`.
* ScanCode Workbench >= v2 is only compatible with scans from 
[ScanCode v2.0.0](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases) and 
above which are run with the ScanCode `-i` option. For a list of available ScanCode 
options see [How To: Set what will be detected in a scan](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_set_what_will_be_detected_in_a_scan.html)

```bash
./scancode -clipeu <input> <output_file>
```

* We have provided a set of sample scans that you can quickly review in 
ScanCode Workbench in order to get a sense of its functionality and the types of 
information captured by a scan.  The samples are located at 
[https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/tree/develop/samples](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/tree/develop/samples).
* Import a ScanCode JSON file, and see what components are in your software! See 
the [documentation](https://scancode-workbench.readthedocs.io) for more 
information on how to use ScanCode Workbench.

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) 
installed on your computer in order to build this app. For a list of platform 
specific requirements, see the Building section of the [documentation](https://scancode-workbench.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contribute/building.html).
Then, from your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd scancode-workbench

# Install dependencies and run the app
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

## Release Instructions

You can build a `dist` directory containing executables for any one of three 
target platforms by running:

```bash
$ python build.py
```

After building is done, you can find `ScanCode-Workbench` under 
`dist/ScanCode-Workbench-<os>-x64-<version>`. Archives (tar.gz and .zip) are 
also built.

Note: A build for any of the three target platforms must be executed on the 
targeted platform.

## Testing

Test ABCM functionality using:

```bash
$ npm test
```
