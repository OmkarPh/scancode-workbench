Not sure what to do with 
Top-level/Codebase-level changes:
A new codebase level attribute 'packages' has been added.
A new codebase level attribute 'dependencies' has been added.

Resource-level changes:
There is a new resource-level attribute 'for_packages'.
^^ Confusion, whether to have it as column group or something else
