:index:`Contributing Code`
==========================

- Contributions comes as bugs/questions/issues and as pull requests.
- Source code and runtime data are in the ``src/`` directory.
- Test code and test data are in the ``tests/`` directory.
- We use DCO signoff in commit messages, like Linux does.
