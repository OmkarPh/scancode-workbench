| Project: `Scancode-Workbench <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_

Overview
---------------
ScanCode Workbench provides an advanced visual UI to help you quickly evaluate
license and other notices identified by 
`ScanCode <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/>`_.
ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, packages
and other interesting information in your code that can be visualised efficiently using workbench.

The GSoC project's goal was to refactor ScanCode Workbench to a React + Typescript implementation and improve various sections of the application including Table view, file uploads, data sync across components, etc.
Plus, the workbench wasn't updated for a long time, to support the latest scans from scancode-toolkit, hence the schema and UI had to be changed accordingly.

Goals achieved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Refactor Workbench from vanilla javascript to React + Typescript implementation
* Update Workbench to support the latest scancode-toolkit output format. (currently supports outputs from scancode-toolkit v31.1.1)
* Improve User experience in Tableview, Home page, etc
* Add convenience features like Drop files, History records, etc.
* Add new sections for Scan Info, package info, etc


Hereâ€™s a quick look at the application:

Post GSoC - Future Plans and what's left
-------------------------------------------
I wish to carry on with the development of Scancode-workbench and implement the
ideas suggested by my mentors. Workbench isn't yet utilising all the scan data it imports, I wish to propose best ways to express this data.
Moreover, with new release formats of scancode-toolkit, workbench must adapt and update its schema & UI at pace with scancode-toolkit.

Closing Thoughts
-------------------

It was a great experience contributing to Workbench, Aboutcode team provided me with the freedom to implement UI improvements and suggested a lot of improvements throughout the journey.
I learned a lot of things from working on an electron app to creating automated GitHub release scripts.
