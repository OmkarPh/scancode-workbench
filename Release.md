### Note - Due to new features & schema changes, you'll have to re-import scans in workbench, previously generated sqlite files aren't compatible with this and further releases

## ScanCode Toolkit Compatibility

This v4.0.3 of ScanCode Workbench is compatible with scans from any
[ScanCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/) releases
at or after
[`v32.0.0`](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/releases/tag/v32.0.0rc4)
and also from the latest develop, but using the latest `v32.x` stable releases
is recommended:
[latest SCTK release](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/releases/latest).
